<h1>Research Projects</h1>
<h3>A data-driven approach to examine non-commuter parking behavior and experience using crowdsourced location-based data</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Applied text mining, sentiment analysis and emotion mapping to the crowdsourced social media data -- Yelp reviews -- for examining the non-commuter parking experience in commercial urban areas and evaluating land use planning performance.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Big data, transportation accessibility, and travel mode choice</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Applied text analytics to the Yelp reviews for investigating how the distance to urban rail transit is correlated to different travel mode recommendations in various spatial divisions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>A machine learning approach to identifying activity/travel behavior using travel survey data and land use data</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Applied Support Vector Machine (SVM) to 2010 Portland Travel Diary Dataset (>10,000 sample data) for classifying activity/travel behavior based on a number of attributes (i.e., time stamp and land-use type of trip ends, a set of spatiotemporal indices of travel, and demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of respondents).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Twitter opinion mining and sentiment analysis on driverless technology</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Developed backend code to map stream of twitter posts to eight different emotions in order to determine perceptions on driverless technology from different demographic groups.</li>
</ul>
